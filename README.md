A TypeScript monorepo for trading services powered by [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## What's Inside

This monorepo uses Nx with TypeScript to manage multiple packages and applications. The workspace is configured with:

- **TypeScript** - Strict type checking and modern ES2022 features
- **Nx** - Build system and monorepo management
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **npm workspaces** - Dependency management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm (v8 or higher recommended)

### Installation

```sh
npm install
```

## Workspace Structure

```
lc-trading-services/
├── packages/          # Your libraries and applications go here
├── node_modules/      # Dependencies
├── nx.json           # Nx workspace configuration
├── package.json      # Root package configuration
├── tsconfig.base.json # Base TypeScript configuration
└── tsconfig.json     # Root TypeScript configuration
```

## Generate a library

Create a new library in the workspace:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/js:lib packages/my-library --publishable --importPath=@lc-trading-services/my-library
```

This will create a new TypeScript library under the `packages/` directory.

## Common Commands

### Build all projects

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```

### Lint code

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Type checking

```sh
npm run typecheck
```

### Format code

```sh
npm run format
```

### Visualize project dependencies

```sh
npm run graph
```

## Run individual project tasks

To build a specific library:

```sh
npx nx build my-library
```

To run any task with Nx:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Versioning and releasing

To version and release the library use

```
npx nx release
```

Pass `--dry-run` to see what would happen without actually releasing the library.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
