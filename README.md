# Life Cockpit Trading Services

A TypeScript-based monorepo for trading data services, providing modular libraries for fetching and managing financial market data. Built with Nx, this project offers type-safe interfaces and implementations for accessing trading data from various sources.

## Overview

This repository contains reusable TypeScript libraries designed to facilitate integration with financial data providers. The project follows a clean architecture approach by separating interface definitions from concrete implementations, enabling flexibility and testability in your trading applications.

**Key Features:**
- üîå Provider-agnostic trading data interfaces
- üìä Yahoo Finance integration for real-time and historical data
- üí± Support for Forex, stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies
- ‚è±Ô∏è Multiple time intervals (1m to 1mo)
- üì¶ Publishable npm packages
- ‚úÖ Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- üß™ Comprehensive test coverage

## Project Structure

```

### Libraries

The project currently does not have an `/apps` directory - all functionality is provided through reusable libraries in the `/libs` directory. Each library is a standalone, publishable npm package that can be consumed by external applications.

#### Available Libraries

The repository contains the following libraries:

#### `lc-trading-data-interface`

**Package:** `@lc-trading-services/lc-trading-data-interface`

This library provides TypeScript interfaces and types that define the contract for trading data providers. It serves as the foundation for all trading data implementations in the project.

**Key Exports:**
- `ITradingDataProvider` - Main interface for data providers
- `OHLCVData` - Open, High, Low, Close, Volume data structure
- `QuoteData` - Real-time quote information
- `HistoricalDataParams` - Parameters for historical data requests
- `TimeInterval` - Supported time intervals (1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 1d, 1wk, 1mo)

**Purpose:** Decouples data consumers from specific provider implementations, enabling easy swapping of data sources without code changes.

#### `trading-data-client`

**Package:** `@lc-trading-services/trading-data-client`

A concrete implementation of the `ITradingDataProvider` interface using Yahoo Finance as the data source. This client provides production-ready access to financial market data.

**Features:**
- Real-time quotes for stocks, Forex, and cryptocurrencies
- Historical OHLCV data with configurable time intervals
- Support for intraday and daily data
- Robust error handling
- Type-safe API based on the interface definitions

**Supported Assets:**
- Forex pairs (e.g., `EURUSD`, `EUR/USD`)
- Stocks (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`)
- ETFs and indices
- Cryptocurrencies (e.g., `BTC-USD`)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Life-Cockpit/lc-trading-services.git
   cd lc-trading-services
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build all libraries:**
   ```bash
   npx nx run-many -t build
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npx nx run-many -t test
   ```

5. **Type check:**
   ```bash
   npx nx run-many -t typecheck
   ```

### Using the Libraries in Your Project

The library is published to the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) and can be installed using npm:

```bash
npm install @lc-trading-services/trading-data-client
```

The package includes all necessary TypeScript types and interfaces.

**NPM Package:**
- [@lc-trading-services/trading-data-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lc-trading-services/trading-data-client)

Or use it locally during development:

```bash
# In your project
npm install /path/to/lc-trading-services/libs/trading-data-client
```

### Quick Usage Example

Here's a simple example of using the TradingDataClient:

```typescript
import { TradingDataClient } from '@lc-trading-services/trading-data-client';

// Create a client instance
const client = new TradingDataClient();

// Get current quote for EUR/USD (supports multiple formats)
const quote = await client.getQuote('EUR/USD');  // or 'EURUSD'
console.log(`EUR/USD: ${quote.price}`);

// Get historical data
const historicalData = await client.getHistoricalData({
  symbol: 'AAPL',
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  interval: '1d'
});

console.log(`Retrieved ${historicalData.length} data points`);
```

For more detailed examples, see the [trading-data-client README](libs/trading-data-client/README.md) or check the [examples directory](examples/).

### Running Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample code demonstrating library usage:

```bash
# Build the libraries first
npx nx run-many -t build

# Run an example
npx ts-node --esm examples/forex-example.ts
```

## Development Workflow

### Building Specific Libraries

```bash
# Build a single library
npx nx build lc-trading-data-interface
npx nx build trading-data-client

# Build all
npx nx run-many -t build
```

### Testing

```bash
# Test a single library
npx nx test lc-trading-data-interface
npx nx test trading-data-client

# Test all
npx nx run-many -t test
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Type check a single library
npx nx typecheck lc-trading-data-interface

# Type check all
npx nx run-many -t typecheck
```

### Viewing the Project Graph

Visualize project dependencies:

```bash
npx nx graph
```

### Syncing TypeScript Project References

Nx automatically keeps TypeScript project references in sync. To manually sync:

```bash
npx nx sync
```

To verify sync status (useful in CI):

```bash
npx nx sync:check
```

## Publishing to NPM

The `trading-data-client` and `lc-trading-data-interface` libraries are automatically published to NPM when changes are merged to the `main` branch.

### For Library Consumers

Install the package from NPM:

```bash
npm install @lc-trading-services/trading-data-client
```

See the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lc-trading-services/trading-data-client) for the latest version.

### For Maintainers

To publish a new version:

1. Ensure all changes are merged to the `main` branch
2. Create and push a Git tag with the version number following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/):
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run tests and builds
   - Publish to NPM
   - Create a GitHub release

For detailed publishing instructions, see [PUBLISHING.md](PUBLISHING.md).

**Required Setup:**
- NPM token must be configured as `NPM_TOKEN` in GitHub secrets
- Token must have publish permissions for `@lc-trading-services` scope
